# 1. Presentation

**Who** are us?
* We are computer engineers.
* We teach IT in the Canary Islands (iespto.es)

**What** is Asker?
* Cross-platform Ruby tool.
* Free Software license.
* Create many questions from `conceptual map`.

**Why** create Asker?
* Because we are teachers and we want be happy

**How** will we be happy?
* Eliminating repetitive and boring tasks. Example boring task: "correcting the same activity over and over again".

We use Moodle (eLearning Platform) quizzes.
And there is no need to correct quizzes! But also with Asker...

```
We dont need to create questions!
(Leitmotiv)

```

**Where** is useful?
* Asker is ideal for creating activities very quickly on theoretical content of any domain.
* The aim is to improve the quality of life of the teacher.
