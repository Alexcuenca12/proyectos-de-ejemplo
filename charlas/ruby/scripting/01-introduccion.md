# Scripting language from Wikipedia

* A scripting or script language is a **programming language that supports scripts** — programs written for a special run-time environment that **automate the execution of tasks** that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.
* Scripting languages **are often interpreted (rather than compiled)**.
* Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls, and the language allows them to be combined into more complex programs.
* Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, usage of the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games.
* A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language.
* Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as **very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes**.
* The term "scripting language" is also used loosely to refer to **dynamic high-level general-purpose languages**, such as Perl, PowerShell, Python, and Tcl with the term "script" often used for small programs (up to a few thousand lines of code) in such languages, or in domain-specific languages such as the text-processing languages sed and AWK.
